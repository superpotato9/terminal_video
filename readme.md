**Note:** To run these programs, you will need Python 3 installed, alongside NumPy and OpenCV (for image io).


## Displaying Videos as Text
The python script videoToTextColor.py will play back a video provided as an argument along with the width in text chars as text to the terminal.

`python3 videoToTextColor.py your_video_here.mp4 200`

The aspect ratio of the output can be configured in the header of the python file.
